title: Repositories
---

All output of the hackathon is to be made immediately available
somewhere in a publicly accessible place. For source code, this means it
must be deposited in a source code repository that supports annonymous
read access and where it is possible to add new developers from any
institution. Keeping things just on your laptop and passing them back
and forth on USB sticks is not enough.

GitHub, SourceForge, and Google Code are all examples of acceptable
repositories. The choice of repositories is up to each individual team.
If you will be working primarily on the core code for an existing GMOD
component, then you are encouraged to use the GMOD SourceForge CVS
repository. [Scott](User:Scott@scottcain.net "wikilink") or
[Dave](Dave "wikilink") can help you get developer access.

In the first [conference call](Conference_Calls "wikilink"),
[Hilmar](Hilmar "wikilink") suggested that we nail down repositories we
want to use ahead of time, and then assemble an instruction page
(probably this page) on where repositories live, and how to get a hold
of them. This may not always be possible We won't know what the teams
and projects are until part way through Monday.
