* [http://gmod.org/wiki/Talk:Chado_Natural_Diversity_Module_Working_Group the talk page] for the above, which actually appears more informative! 
* Has the new Chadoesque version of the Chado ND schema mentioned on these pages already been released?  Where could we see it?
* The [[Diversity and Phenotypes]] abstract mentions "A recently reported prototype of a Chado data adapter for Phenote, GMODs phenotype annotation tool, could be generalized to become the data persistence interface for such data."  Is there a paper or another source that reports on this adapter?
