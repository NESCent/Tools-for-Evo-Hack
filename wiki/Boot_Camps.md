Current state of Chado Natural Diversity module
-----------------------------------------------

People interested in attending: [Vladimir](User:Vg34 "wikilink")

Resources I am aware of:

-   [Chado Natural Diversity Module Working
    Group](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Natural_Diversity_Module_Working_Group)
-   [the talk
    page](http://gmod.org/wiki/Talk:Chado_Natural_Diversity_Module_Working_Group)
    for the above, which actually appears more informative!

Has the new Chadoesque version of the Chado ND schema mentioned on these
pages already been released? Where could we see it?
