; Motivation
With the addition of the geolocation tables to the ND natural Diversity Module it is envisaged that researchers from a variety of fields (no pun intended) will want to display data in reference to the location in which a survey / experiment was carried out.  

; Key Challenges
#Requirements
#* what kind of data can it display? can everything be reduced to:
#*#coloured pushpins (i.e. Anopheles gambiae found here = green dot, arabiensis here = yellow dot, stephensi = blue dot)
#*#or a two-colour scale (% of major v minor allele found in these location)
#*how scalable is the data? and is it desirable to take steps to limit # of sites displayed for the sake of speed? 

#Implementation
#*it is presumed the system would use the Google Maps API, or something similar in order to display the data - does this have the flexibility we would need? 
#*If we decide to pursue this we could have a server set up to feed simple json classes from the natdiv database. 
#**would this be flexible enough to allow further development after the hackathon?
#**is an alternative to json preferable? 

; Preconditions for Use:
*geolocations to be stored in ND geolocation tables
*values to be plotted taken from either:
**phenotype module
**genotype module
**stock prop
*and directly related to
**stock

; User Steps
*e.g. show frequencies of 2La / 2L+ inversions for all samples in cameroon.
*e.g. show locations for all samplings in project X
*+ others (please add your own)

; Results
*map with pins for binary values / heatmaps for real no.s
