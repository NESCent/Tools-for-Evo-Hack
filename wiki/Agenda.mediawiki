|8:40 -10:00 a.m.||	Presentations by each breakout group. <br/> Breakout Groups will present their ideas for discussion to the overall workshop.  These presentations and the resulting discussions will form the basis for 5-10 page reports from each Breakout Group, to be produced after the meeting.  Each presentation will last 15-20 minutes, with time for discussion by the overall group.  Final reports for each Breakout Group are due to the organizers by end of September.  Reports can be posted on [[Documents|this site]]. These reports will then be synthesized into a final workshop document that will be distributed.  Perhaps presented to the community for discussion at the Philadelphia GSA/PS meeting  and other appropriate society meetings?  We also plan to publish a report, place on web, etc
