### Resources

NESCent is equipped with a complete set of IT and office resources to
support the needs of meeting participants. They are explained in detail
in the [IT & General Help article](Help:Contents "wikilink").

In short, all meeting and break-out spaces are covered by wireless
network. Wired network jacks are available in the conference rooms and
at the back of the large meeting space too. We have a system
administrator on staff to assist you ad-hoc with computer problems.
Video projectors and a loaner laptop for displaying Powerpoint
presentations are available. You may submit your presentation
electronically to the meeting organizer either by email, or using a USB
memory stick (your own or supplied by us).

In terms of office resources, there are fully networked printers you can
use, as well as a copier that doubles as a scanner. For high-end
printing and finishing needs, a FedexKinko's is right across the street.

### Arrival at Raleigh/Durham International Airport (RDU)

please call the Millennium Hotel via the display of hotels at the
Baggage claim area. You may pick up the receiver and push the
appropriate button for the Millennium Hotel, or you may call the
Millennium at (919) 383-8575. Please tell the attendant that you have a
reservation and wish to be picked up at the RDU airport. The hotel is
approximately 10 minutes away. Any ground transportation questions
arising immediately after arrival can be answered at the RDU Information
Desk near the Baggage Claim area.

NESCent office for your meeting.

Meal Arrangements

We are able to reimburse you up to $36.75 for meals on your arrival
travel day and for your departure travel day, providing you can furnish
NESCent with original receipts. Reimbursable meal receipts cannot exceed
$49.00 for a full (non-travel) meeting day at NESCent. These amounts are
based upon US Government rates and are subject to change. Please see the
information sent to you regarding your specific meeting.

NESCent is unable to reimburse you for any alcohol purchases, and cannot
process meal receipts with any alcohol line-items. Please make sure
there are no alcohol charges on your submitted receipt.

NESCent can reimburse you for your local airport parking, travel to the
airport, and related ground transportation, with your original receipts.

In order to process your reimbursement, NESCent will need your home
address and your social security number. Without your home address,
NESCent cannot process any reimbursement to you. NESCent will process
reimbursement checks which will be mailed to your home address within
approximately 45 days after you send us your original receipts.

Non-U.S. Citizens
-----------------

We would appreciate your letting us know if you are not a US citizen. If
you will be arriving from outside the United States, we will provide you
with a formal letter of invitation briefly outlining the purpose of your
visit. This letter may be required during your travel to the US, and we
encourage you to keep a copy with you. Please send via email your office
mailing address so that we can send the formal letter of invitation. For
