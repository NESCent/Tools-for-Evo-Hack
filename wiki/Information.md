section.

**Specific travel information for your group can be downloaded here:

Hotel Arrangements:
-------------------

NESCent will pay for your room, while you will be responsible for all
other incidental room charges, including phone calls and meals you might
charge to your room.

If your travel plans change and you are not able to attend the meeting,
please assist NESCent in avoiding any hotel penalties by contacting
Danielle Wilson at NESCent via email <danielle@nescent.org> or phone at
919-668-4545 to make any changes or cancel your room reservations.

Travel Arrangements:
--------------------

Your airfare will be directly billed to NESCent. A condition of your
invitation to participate in any NESCent event, we ask that your travel
plans be ticketed no less than 21 days in advance of your arrival date.
In some circumstances, particularly for international travel, we may
request that you extend your stay to include a Saturday night. In
addition, our travel agent has been instructed to search for lower-cost
airfares for all attendees.

NESCent cannot guarantee the reimbursement of any non-NESCent travel
agent travel arrangements. Attendees wishing to make their own travel
plans should seek approval prior to making any financial commitments on
their part.

In addition, the National Science Foundation requires that we use U.S.
air carriers and coach class. If you are a Federal employee, please
contact Danielle Wilson at NESCent immediately before arranging your
airline travel.

**SPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL VISITORS TO THE UNITED STATES**

Beginning January 12, 2009, all VWP (Visa Waiver Program) nationals and
citizens will be required to obtain a travel authorization prior to
initiating travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.
This authorization may be obtained on-line through a free Internet
application administered by the Department of Homeland Security through
a U.S. government web site. There is no fee for completion of an ESTA
application. For complete information, please go to:
<http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/id_visa/esta/>

Arrival at Raleigh/Durham International Airport (RDU):
------------------------------------------------------

Upon arrival to the airport, please take a taxi to the hotel. The taxis
are available outside the Baggage Claim areas.

Getting to NESCent:
-------------------

NESCent will coordinate daily shuttle service between the hotel and the
NESCent office for your visit. We will also pre-schedule your out-bound
airport shuttles (if applicable). A schedule will be distributed upon
your arrival at NESCent.

Meal Arrangements:
------------------

Non-Duke University Employees – Per Diem:

1.  NESCent is limited by the US Government’s meal per diem rates.
    NESCent may modify these rates.
2.  Due to Duke University policies, it is not possible to offer
    attendees a meal program of NESCent-paid meals and partial
    per diems. We have found it more efficient to provide attendees with
    a post-meeting reimbursement for a pre-established GSA-related per
    diem rate. Attendees (non-Duke attendees) are not required to
    provide NESCent with any meal receipts as part of this program.
3.  ***Please note that NSF prohibits the reimbursement for any
    alcohol***.
4.  NESCent will communicate to your attendees the reimbursement rates
    for the meeting.
5.  NESCent may modify the reimbursement rates for meetings.

Non-US Citizens – Original Receipts:
------------------------------------

1.  Because per diem reimbursements for foreign nationals can be taxed
    at 36%, it is recommended that NESCent reimbursement you based on
    original meal receipts.
2.  ***NSF prohibits the reimbursement for any alcohol.* *Please note
    that we cannot reimburse you for your meal if alcoholic beverages
    appear on your receipt***. Please consult with your restaurant
    server to insure that alcoholic beverages do not appear on your
    receipt for NESCent.
3.  Amounts for meals are based upon the US Government’s per diem rates.
    These pre-established and meeting-specific rates will be
    communicated to participants prior to the meeting and will outline
    additional details and the process for reimbursing their expenses.

NSF/NESCent Travel Policy
=========================

Flight Arrangements:
--------------------

1.  We are required by NSF to use US-based air-carriers and require
    coach-class tickets. Occasionally, there are situations where US
    carriers are not available. We address these on a
    case-by-case basis.
2.  There are rare occasions where an attendee may request an exemption
    to coach-class travel for medical reasons. These are addressed on a
    case-by-case basis and may require a written statement from the
    attendee’s physician for full consideration. This is a NSF policy.
3.  NESCent expects all participants to select lower cost, 21-day
    advance purchase tickets through NESCent’s selected travel agent. In
    some circumstances, particularly for international travel, we may
    request that you extend your stay to include a Saturday night. We
    will provide all attendees our travel agent’s name, email address,
    toll-free telephone number and related contact information, and ask
    them to contact our agent.
4.  All flight arrangements should be made through a NESCent
    travel agent. Once attendees have made their travel plans and their
    tickets have been purchased, it will be the responsibility of the
    attendee to pay for any non-emergency ticket changes. Emergency
    ticket changes (such as family, or medical issues, etc.) are
    addressed upon a case-by-case basis and may not be approved or paid
    for by NESCent.
5.  Although cancelled tickets are usually in the name of the attendee,
    NESCent hopes that the attendee will be able to use the canceled
    ticket a for a future NESCent activity.

Luggage:
--------

1.  **NESCent will not reimburse attendees for expenses related
    to luggage.**

Ground transportation:
----------------------

1.  Attendees may choose to drive to their meeting at NESCent. In these
    cases and at NESCent’s discretion, NESCent may choose to offer the
    attendee reimbursement equal to the GSA mileage rate for the
    round-trip drive or a 21-day advance purchase air fare, whichever
    is lower. Long distance driving reimbursements will be evaluated on
    a case-by-case basis.
2.  NESCent will pay for shuttles to and from the Raleigh/Durham (RDU)
    airport to the selected hotel and NESCent, and strongly suggests
    using the selected hotel’s shuttle.
3.  NESCent will reimburse attendees for routine airport parking and
    related hometown ground-travel expenses with original
    receipts.\#Attendees arriving at or after 9:00 p.m. should take a
    taxi to the hotel. Taxis may be found outside the Baggage Claim
    areas at the RDU Airport.
4.  NESCent cannot pay for limousines or car rentals.

Lodging and reimbursement rates:
--------------------------------

1.  NESCent will select the hotel and will coordinate all reservations
    for the attendees.
2.  NESCent is limited by the US Government's rates in the lodging fees
    that it can pay.
3.  NESCent will pay for attendees' lodging for the dates of the
    meeting, usually including arriving the day prior to the meeting and
    departure the afternoon or evening of the last meeting day. Return
    flights to some locations may require departure the day following
    the meeting's adjournment. Meeting coordinators can request an
    arrival or departure beyond this framework for themselves.

Other Reimbursements:

    attendee's home address. Attendees will be requested to provide
    their home address (and social security number if also receiving a
    per diem reimbursement) prior to the meeting.
3.  Attendees will be given a letter outlining their reimbursement
    process, and a pre-addressed envelope for sending their **original
    receipts** to NESCent.
4.  Processing reimbursements will take approximately 45 days, assuming
    attendees immediately provide their **original receipts** and
    home address. Individual situations may take longer.
5.  NESCent provides reimbursement in US dollars. Attendees wishing to
    receive reimbursement in alternative currencies or wire transfers
    will be responsible for the payment (or deduction from
    reimbursement amounts) of all currency change fees. Historically
    these fees have been $20 for alternative currencies and $45 for
    wire transfers.
6.  We recommend that foreign nationals submit original receipts for
    reimbursement of all expenses. Without a social security number and
    an international tax treaty agreement with the United States of
    America, taxes may be withheld at 36% from all
    reimbursements submitted.
