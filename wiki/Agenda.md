First Teleconference Agenda
===========================

The first call is

-   October 4, 2010, 4pm Eastern US. **OR**
-   October 7, 2010, 3pm Eastern US.

We will cover the same topics in both calls. Please participate in
whichever one is more convenient.

1.  [Objectives](Objectives "wikilink"): Quick review of the
    three objectives.
2.  Introductions: what [participants](participants "wikilink")'
    interests are, and what you want to work on.
3.  Resources
    -   [Mailing List](Lists "wikilink"): all participants can post.
    -   This wiki: All participants can update. High quality content
        will be copied to [main GMOD wiki](gmod:Main_Page "wikilink")
        after the event.

4.  Pre-hackathon work
    -   [Use Cases](Use_Cases "wikilink"): Clearly stated, concrete
        problems that can't be addressed currently, and that we could
        make significant progress towards during the hackathon.
        -   Use cases should be *ripe for implementation.* Ideas should
            be addressable with code and should not be open ended.
    -   Coalescing: Participants are encouraged to put forth use cases
        and advocate that they be worked on, and to do this before the
        event even starts.
    -   At least one more conference call, week of Oct 18-22. *Please
        [fill out the Doodle poll](http://doodle.com/du2yy3g2chft2srn).*
    -   Please think about what training,if any, you would like to have
        on the first day. Are there APIs or architectures you need to
        learn about that will help you during the week? We'll run needed
        boot camps on the first day.
    -   Update the [participants](participants "wikilink") page and
        create your own user pages.

5.  Mechanics of the hackathon itself
    -   First day; intros, proposals, coalescing, hacking
    -   Subsequent days: progress reports, hacking
    -   Bring your own laptop. If you can't let [Dave](Dave "wikilink")
        know ASAP.
    -   Source code [repositories](repositories "wikilink").

We don't expect to discuss [objectives](objectives "wikilink") in detail
on this first call
