First Teleconference Agenda
===========================

October 4, 2010, 4pm Eastern.

-   [Objectives](Objectives "wikilink"): Quick review of the
    three objectives.
-   Introductions: what [participants](participants "wikilink")'
    interests are, and what you want to work on.
-   Resources
    -   [Mailing List](Lists "wikilink"): all participants can post.
    -   This wiki: All participants can update. High quality content
        will be copied to [main GMOD wiki](gmod:Main_Page "wikilink")
        after the event.
          
        **Q:** Should the hackathon wiki be wide open for viewing to
        anyone, or should it require a login to view pages?
-   Pre-hackathon work
    -   [Use Cases](Use_Cases "wikilink"): Clearly stated, concrete
        problems that can't be addressed currently, and that we could
        make significant progress towards during the hackathon.
    -   Coalescing: Participants are encouraged to put forth use cases
        and advocate that they be worked on, and to do this before the
        event even starts.
    -   A couple more conference calls
    -   Update the [participants](participants "wikilink") page and
        create your own user pages.
-   Mechanics of the hackathon itself
    -   First day; intros, proposals, coalescing, hacking
    -   Subsequent days: progress reports, hacking

We don't expect to discuss [objectives](objectives "wikilink") in detail
on this first call
