<big>WORKSHOP: NESCENT/PIRE – CATALYSIS GROUP MEETING: AGENDA</big>

`“Perspectives on the Origin and Conservation of Biodiversity in Patagonia”`  
`Jack W. Sites, Jr. and Daniel G. Faith`  
`16 – 19 June 2008; Duke University, Durham, NC`

Themes of the discussion:
=========================

1.  “What is an integrated biodiversity research plan”?
2.  new tools/methods (in comparative phylogeography)
3.  extensions of phylogeography into other disciplines
    (macroecology, etc.)
4.  effective linkages to DIVERSITAS/GBIF objectives, the emerging GEO
    Global Biodiversity Observation Network, & conservation
5.  future collaborative review papers, research proposals, etc.
6.  information exchange across disciplines
