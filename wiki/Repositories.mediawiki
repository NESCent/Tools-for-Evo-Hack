All output of the hackathon is to be made immediately available somewhere in a publicly accessible place.  For source code, this means it must be deposited in a source code repository that supports annonymous read access and where it is possible to add new developers from any institution.  Keeping things just on your laptop and passing them back and forth on USB sticks is not enough.

GitHub, SourceForge, and Google Code are all examples of acceptable repositories.  The choice of repositories is up to each individual team.  

If you will be working primarily on the core code for an existing GMOD component, then you are encouraged to use the GMOD SourceForge CVS repository.  [[User:Scott@scottcain.net|Scott]] or [[Dave]] can help you get developer access.  If you really want a GMOD project moved from SVN to Git before the hackathon, ''and'' you can convince the lead developers that it is a good idea, then [[Rob]] is willing to help with the migration to Git.

In the first [[Conference Calls|conference call]], [[Hilmar]] suggested that we nail down repositories we want to use ahead of time, and then assemble an instruction page (probably this page) on where repositories live, and how to get a hold of them.  This may not always be possible  We won't know what the teams and projects are until part way through Monday.
