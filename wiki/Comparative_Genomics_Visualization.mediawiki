[[gmod:GBrowse_syn|GBrowse_syn]] is a popular GMOD component for viewing comparative genomics data, particularly for viewing synteny between genomes.  It does not currently support the [[gmod:Next Generation Sequencing|next-generation sequencing (NGS) data]] increasingly available for comparative genomics and emerging model systems. Support for NGS data was identified by the EMS working group as a high priority.

In particular, GBrowse_syn lacks support for the [http://samtools.sourceforge.net/ Sequence Alignment Format (SAM)], its mechanism of storing genome comparisons does not scale beyond a few organisms,  and the means for tracking the necessary alignment metadata in [[gmod:Chado|Chado]] are insufficient.

In addition to filling those gaps, GBrowse_syn would also particularly stand to benefit from the event by gaining a more sustainable developer base.
