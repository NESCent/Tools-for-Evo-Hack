===Resources===

NESCent is equipped with a complete set of IT and office resources to support the needs of meeting participants. They are explained in detail in the [[Help:Contents|IT &amp; General Help article]].

In short, all meeting and break-out spaces are covered by wireless network. Wired network jacks are available in the conference rooms and at the back of the large meeting space too. We have a system administrator on staff to assist you ad-hoc with computer problems. Video projectors and a loaner laptop for displaying Powerpoint presentations are available. You may submit your presentation electronically to the meeting organizer either by email, or using a USB memory stick (your own or supplied by us).

In terms of office resources, there are fully networked printers you can use, as well as a copier that doubles as a scanner. For high-end printing and finishing needs, a FedexKinko's is right across the street.

==Hotel Arrangements==
You will be staying at the [http://www.millenniumhotels.com/MCIL.nsf/LU_HOTELDOC/113$$HotelDescription?OpenDocument Millennium Hotel] in Durham, (2800 Campus Walk Avenue, Durham, NC  27705, telephone: (919) 383 8575).

Reservations have been made for 3 nightsâ€™ lodging, Wednesday, Aug. 23 through Friday August 25.  The current agenda plans for you to arrive on Wednesday, August 23, meet Thursday, Friday and Saturday, departing on Saturday late PM or Sunday, August 26 or 27. (The meeting is expected to end about 2 to 3 PM on Saturday).  Check in time at the Millennium Hotel is 3:00 p.m. and check out time is noon.  Please contact Jeff Sturkey at NESCent via email [mailto:jsturkey@nescent.org jsturkey@nescent.org] or 919-668-4551 to make any changes to your room reservations.  The rooms will be directly billed to the grant supporting this workshop.  We will pay for your room, while you will be responsible for all other incidental room charges, including meals you might charge to your room.  If you are bringing a roommate, there will be an additional charge of $20.00 per person per night payable to the Millennium Hotel.

==Travel Arrangements==
Please contact our travel agent, Cindy Talisman, as soon as possible to arrange your airline travel.  Please note that as a condition of your invitation to participate, we ask that your travel plans be ticketed no less than 21 days in advance of your meeting, August 1.  In addition, our travel agent has been instructed to search for lower-cost airfares for all attendees.  

Your early selection of flights will provide you the widest choices.  In addition, please note that the National Science Foundation requires that we use U.S. air carriers and coach class. 

Your airfare charge will be reimbursed from the grant.  According to UNC regulations, this is separate from other reimbursements.  Please provide your name, home address, and social security number to {mailto: pgensel@bio.unc.edu Pat Gensel] at the time you have your booking and we can start to process reimbursement.  Although we have provided the travel agency with your names, we ask that you directly [mailto:cltalisman@hotmail.com contact Cindy].  Her contact information is:

It would be helpful if you could make your travel arrangements as soon as possible.  We also suggest using the Millennium Hotel shuttle service.  This shuttle will be directly billed to the grant, and is less expensive than other transport to the hotel.

==Transportation==

===Arrival at Raleigh/Durham International Airport (RDU)===
We suggest using the Millennium Hotel airport shuttle service.  This shuttle will be directly billed to the grant.  When you arrive at RDU, please call the Millennium Hotel via the display of hotels at the Baggage claim area.  You may pick up the receiver and push the appropriate button for the Millennium Hotel, or you may call the [http://www.millenniumhotels.com/MCIL.nsf/LU_HOTELDOC/113$$HotelDescription?OpenDocument Millennium] at (919) 383-8575.  Please tell the attendant that you have a reservation and wish to be picked up at the RDU airport.  The hotel is approximately 10 minutes away.  Any ground transportation questions arising immediately after arrival can be answered at the RDU Information Desk near the Baggage Claim area.

===Getting to NESCent===
We will also coordinate shuttle service between the hotel and the NESCent office for your meeting.

==Meal Arrangements== 
We will be basing your meal reimbursement on the State of North Carolina rates.  We are able to reimburse participants up to a total of approximately $32/day for the meals at the meeting.  This includes some meals on your arrival and departure days.  A major advantage of this system is that you are not required to keep or furnish us with any meal receipts.  After the meeting, UNC Biology Accounting will process reimbursements which will be mailed within approximately 45 days- keep any receipts for taxi, airfare (if necessary).  University of North Carolina policy dictates that these reimbursements must be sent to your home address.  Please complete the attached home address form and return it to Patricia Gensel prior to your arrival.

==Non-U.S. Citizens==
We would appreciate your letting us know if you are not a US citizen.  If you will be arriving from outside the United States, we will provide you with a formal letter of invitation briefly outlining the purpose of your visit.  This letter may be required during your travel to the US, and we encourage you to keep a copy with you.  Please send via email your office mailing address so that we can send the formal letter of invitation.  For all non-US citizens we will need to make a copy of your passport and I-94 and/or visa waiver during your visit.
