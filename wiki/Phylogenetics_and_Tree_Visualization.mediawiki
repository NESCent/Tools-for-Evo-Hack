The [[gmod:GMOD Components|GMOD toolkit]] at present does not include web-based alignment viewers, nor can the increasingly popular [[gmod:JBrowse|JBrowse]] genome browser (the designated successor of [[gmod:GBrowse|GBrowse]]) display multiple sequence alignments. GMOD also lacks a phylogenetic tree widget.

Implementing these from scratch would be far beyond a suitable hackathon target. However, [http://solgenomics.net SGN] has a relatively mature [http://solgenomics.net/tools/align_viewer/ web-based multiple alignment and tree browser] that could be extracted from SGN's codebase and transformed into a GMOD component, an add-on for JBrowse.  Current Java-based tree viewers (such as [http://www.phylosoft.org/atv/ Archaeopteryx] or [http://www.phylowidget.org PhyloWidget]) could be used as the basis for a JavaScript-based tree viewer (or an applet that can be controlled through JavaScript) that integrates with JBrowse.
