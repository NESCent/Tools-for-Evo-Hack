Hackathon Best Practices
------------------------

NESCent hosts several hackathons a year, and hosting hackathons is one
of NESCent's core functions. This page describes some best practices for
having a successful hackathon.

1.  The Key Idea: This is not a workshop or a symposium: It's a group
    that is gathered to work together over to make real progress on a
    specific project in a limited amount of time.
2.  Many hackathons have members that are veterans of previous NESCent
    or other hackathons. Leverage their experience to help with
    this group.
3.  Brief introductions of each person and their research perspective on
    the goals of the group are useful, but strongly resist the (natural)
    tendency for people to give talks about their research. Keep in mind
    that nearly everyone in the group is simultaneously an expert in
    some issues and a neophyte in other issues.
4.  Have a clear but flexible agenda for the hackathon in advance, and
    give clear instructions to participants about what you want them
    to do.
5.  Successful hackathons tend towards firm, organized, but
    flexible leadership. You want to take advantage of the diverse
    viewpoints/strengths of the group, let new ideas emerge and be
    explored, but keep the group focused on the project goals and on
    making progress towards that.
6.  Identify related objectives within the larger project goal, so that
    interconnected subsets of people can work on these somewhat
    independently (with communication among subgroups). Usually these
    subgroups emerge naturally, but you may need to help this along.
    Alternating between large group and subgroup meetings typically
    works pretty well.
7.  Have fun.
