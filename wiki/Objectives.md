Organizers have identified the following broad themes for focusing work
at the event. Before and at the hackathon, the participants will refine
and distill these and other options into concrete implementation
targets. The participants will develop criteria for prioritization, such
as maturity of a target for implementation, availability of test data,
and potential for completing or making significant progress towards the
target during the hackathon. Further ideas and discussion topics can be
found on the [ Supplemental Information
](gmod:GMOD_Evo_Hackathon_Proposal_Supplemental_Information "wikilink")
page.
